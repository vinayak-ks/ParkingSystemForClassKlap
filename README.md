       1) Since there is no constraint about number of entry / exit points this applications has been designed and developed assuming there is only one entry / exit point.

       2) If there is a requirement for the multiple entry / exit points this application needs to be made Thread Safe by synchronizing park and leave operations.

       3) In this application the main business is parking , I made sure that the application is faster by using the TreeSet and HashMap for parking and leaving the car
